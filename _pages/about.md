I am a **researcher** at the [Norwegian Institute for Nature Research]() working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, statistics, bioacoustics and more generally biodiversity conservation.

My **interests** lies in using and developing methods for better biodiversity monitoring. During my PhD I have worked on improving the way Citizen Science can be used to infer species characteristics. In my current position I primarily develop deep learning algorithms for species detections on both camera trap pictures and audio recordings.


**My passion** for my work stems from a general curiosity and deep desire to understand complex systems, and the wish to keep up with the potential of and challenges around artificial intelligence.
