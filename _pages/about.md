I am a **researcher** at the [Norwegian Institute for Nature Research](https://www.nina.no/english/home) working with artificial intelligence, statistics and biodiversity conservation. Most of my work is hosted on our institutional GitHub [NINAnor](https://github.com/NINAnor).

My work focus on **developing** and **using** deep learning algorithms for biodiversity conservation. I am particularly interested in **using AI in bioacoustic** (e.g. detection and classification of audio events) but also using **AI for image processing** (e.g. detection and classification of animals). I code mostly in Python but I do love R for data analysis and for making fancy plots (`ggplot2` is the best).

I am also very found of **grappling sports** and in particular wrestling and brazilian jiu jitsu and when not at work I am usually on the mat trying some fancy takedowns or some techniques I saw on instagram 🤼‍♂️

I am always open for new collaborations so don’t hesitate to send me a [mail](benjamin.cretois@nina.no).
