I am a **researcher** at the [Norwegian Institute for Nature Research](https://www.nina.no/english/home) working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, statistics, bioacoustics and more generally biodiversity conservation.

Being a member of the [environmental data (Miljødata) team](https://www.nina.no/Kart), my work focus on developing and using **deep learning algorithms** for biodiversity conservation. I am particularly interested in using AI in **bioacoustic**. I am also developing guidelines for [using supercomputers (UNINETT Sigma2 in particular)](https://ninanor.github.io/91126800_ML_and_associated_tech/) as well as the associated technologies (e.g. containers, softwares for parallelizing AI workflows etc.).

I am also very found of grappling sports and in particular wrestling and brazilian jiu jitsu and when not at work I am usually on the mat trying some fancy takedowns 🤼‍♂️

I am always open for new collaborations so don't hesitate to contact me by mail, twitter or any other medium.
