## Professional Experience

<p style="font-size:0.85rem; margin-bottom: 0">2021 - present</p>
<p style="font-size:1.25rem; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Researcher</b> · <i>Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, Trondheim</i></p>

As a researcher in the "environmental data" (Miljødata) team, my work focus on developing AI algorithms for biodiversity conservation in general. I am particularly interested in using AI in bioacoustic and I develop models that aims at detecting anthropogenic noise such as human voice. I am also developing guidelines for using supercomputers (UNINETT Sigma2 in particular) as well as the associated technologies (e.g. containers, softwares for parallelizing AI workflows etc.).
